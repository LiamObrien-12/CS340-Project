Reflection
1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In my projects, especially the CRUD Python module from Project One, I focused on writing modular, well-commented code with clear function names and consistent formatting. Structuring the CRUD operations inside a class made the code easier to maintain and adapt in Project Two when connecting dashboard widgets to the MongoDB database. Working this way made it simple to update queries and add features without breaking existing functionality. In the future, I could reuse this CRUD module whenever a project needs secure and organized database access.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approached the Grazioso Salvare database and dashboard requirements by first clearly understanding the clientâ€™s needs: filtering rescue dogs based on traits and presenting the data visually. I broke the problem down into smaller steps like setting up the database, writing CRUD functions, and then connecting everything in a dashboard. This methodical, modular approach helps reduce errors and makes testing easier. In future projects, I would continue to build databases and dashboards by first planning the structure and then developing the code in small, manageable pieces.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems by designing efficient systems and automating tasks. In this project, I built a dashboard that made it easier for Grazioso Salvare to identify and train rescue dogs. This matters because it saves time, improves decision-making, and helps organizations achieve their missions more effectively. Good database and dashboard designs allow businesses to operate smarter and more efficiently.
